Running To-do list:
1. Create clear documentation for the implementation and usage of David Stark's statistical code wrapper. Some challenges
that arise with this code are the installation of R dependencies on the system and the references made to online 
sources for the R software being implemented.
2. KLM: A collaborator (Jerry Sellwood) is interested in unbarred galaxies and proposing kinematic misalignment as a 
potential way to prevent bar formation (as far as I understand him anyway). Strikes me we have a sample to check this 
out quickly with. If you match with the “friendly” version of GZ:DESI here that would be interesting, and maybe try to
compare histograms of the strong and weak bar fraction vote for the MA and aligned samples. Seems just worth a quick
check. Might not be anything interesting. Sellwood’s galaxies are usually very idealized.
3. "Punchy" graphics to refine: Gas Deficiency vs. Stellar mass for each population (Likely make one for WA, one for MA,
or make sure the different populations are clear enough); CDF of deficiencies from Kaplan-Meier
4. HI-Massfraction-stellarmass-plot from github
