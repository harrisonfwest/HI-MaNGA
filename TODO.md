Running To-do list:
1. Implement Kaplan-Meier statistical test from David Stark's code
2. Investigate specific star formation rate (sSFR, SFR adjusted for stellar mass) vs. HI deficiency using the
sSFR data from MaNGA's pipe3D: https://www.sdss4.org/dr17/manga/manga-data/manga-pipe3d-value-added-catalog/
3. Create clear documentation for the implementation and usage of David Stark's statistical code wrapper. Some challenges
that arise with this code are the installation of R dependencies on the system and the references made to online 
sources for the R software being implemented.
